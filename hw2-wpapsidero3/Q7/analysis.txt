1. Ease to develop for developers
    R: Flexible, relatively user-friendly environment with low learning curve, and abundant resources.
    Tableau: Rigid, user-friendly environment with low learning curve, least time consuming.
    D3: Flexible, non-user-friendly environment with high learning curve, extremely time consuming, with very limited resources and poor flexibility between versions.
2. Ease to maintain the visualization for developers (e.g., difficulty of the maintenance of the product as the requirements change, the data changes, the hosting platform changes, etc.) 
    R: Easy to trace impacts from changes, and impacts are relatively isolated within the code
    Tableau: Easy to make changes when needed, adaptive.
    D3: Breaks with changes to data formatting, needs a lot of debugging to find where the change impacts the code
3. Usability of visualization developed for end users
    R: not interactive but clean and easy to interpret, the least aesthetically pleasing.
    Tableau: Interactive limited to using dashboard, but clean and easy to interpret.
    D3: most interactive, can easily adjust zoom in on more specific data where the user shows interest.
4. Scalability of visualization to “large” datasets
    R: rigid in scalability, needs multiple charts.
    Tableau: being a tool focused on data visualization makes this flexible when operating in a dashboard.
    D3: the interactivity makes this the best at scaling to visualize large data sets.
5. System requirements to run the visualization (e.g., browsers, OS, software licensing) for end users
    R: requires an image viewing software, or R. 
    Tableau: requires Tableau reader for interacting with dashboards, or for images requires an image viewing software.
    D3: requires a browser, often specific browser to run the way it was developed, may need a terminal.
